## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the App, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/PwchiWorld/app/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue [issue form](https://github.com/PwchiWorld/app/issues/new). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/PwchiWorld/app/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, issues are not assigned. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.


### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to [self-review](self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
